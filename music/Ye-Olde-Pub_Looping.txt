PLEASE READ: If you find my work helpful, please consider making a small donation through PayPal 
to support the site. I don’t allow advertising here because I feel it would be distracting 
to my visitors so I pay for everything myself. Also, the keyboards I use to create free music 
for everyone are very expensive…I actually make monthly payments for them…so donations 
from the community help me to pay for them as well. Thanks for helping out.

ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION

In order to use my work legally, you are required to credit me in your actual game, 
video, interactive novel, podcast, etc. Crediting me on the info page on Youtube, 
Google Play, etc. instead of in the actual video, game, novel, etc. is not sufficient. 
(The reason is that people often don’t read the information section.)
